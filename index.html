      <h1>Microsoft</h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology
        corporation which produces computer software, consumer electronics,
        personal computers, and related services. Its best known software
        products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the
        Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers.
        Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the
        Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal <br />
        Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest
        United States corporations by total revenue;[3] it was the world's
        largest software maker by revenue as of 2016.[4] It is considered one of
        the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry,
        along with Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. Microsoft (the word
        being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"[5]) was founded by Bill
        Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC
        interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
        computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed
        by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO),
        and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and
        an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the
        1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market
        and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the
        acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[6] followed
        by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May
        2011.[7] As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC
        compatible operating system market and the office software suite market,
        although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market
        to Android.[8] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer
        and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and
        servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services
        market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure),
        and software development (Visual Studio). Steve Ballmer replaced Gates
        as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services"
        strategy.[9] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in
        2008,[10] entering the personal computer production market for the first
        time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of
        tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the
        acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya
        Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on
        hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped
        the company's shares reach its highest value since December
        1999.[11][12] Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft
        reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in
        the world.[13] In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar
        market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over
        $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively.[14] As of 2020,
        Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.[15]

        Microsoft Word is a word processing software developed by Microsoft. It
        was first released on October 25, 1983,[6] under the name Multi-Tool
        Word for Xenix systems.[7][8][9] Subsequent versions were later written
        for several other platforms including IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple
        Macintosh running the Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&T UNIX PC (1985), Atari
        ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix (1990), and
        macOS (2001). Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone
        product or as a component of Microsoft Office 365, or Microsoft 365
        Premium subscription, Windows RT or the discontinued Microsoft Works
        suite.

        Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program,[6] created by Robert
        Gaskins and Dennis Austin[6] at a software company named Forethought,
        Inc.[6] It was released on April 20, 1987,[7] initially for Macintosh
        computers only.[6] Microsoft acquired PowerPoint for about $14 million
        three months after it appeared.[8] This was Microsoft's first
        significant acquisition,[9] and Microsoft set up a new business unit for
        PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought had been located.[9]
        PowerPoint became a component of the Microsoft Office suite, first
        offered in 1989 for Macintosh[10] and in 1990 for Windows,[11] which
        bundled several Microsoft apps. Beginning with PowerPoint 4.0 (1994),
        PowerPoint was integrated into Microsoft Office development, and adopted
        shared common components and a converged user interface.[12]
        PowerPoint's market share was very small at first, prior to introducing
        a version for Microsoft Windows, but grew rapidly with the growth of
        Windows and of Office.[13]: 402–404  Since the late 1990s, PowerPoint's
        worldwide market share of presentation software has been estimated at 95
        percent.[14] PowerPoint was originally designed to provide visuals for
        group presentations within business organizations, but has come to be
        very widely used in many other communication situations, both in
        business and beyond.[15] The impact of this much wider use of PowerPoint
        has been experienced as a powerful change throughout society,[16] with
        strong reactions including advice that it should be used less,[17]
        should be used differently,[18] or should be used better.[19] The first
        PowerPoint version (Macintosh 1987) was used to produce overhead
        transparencies,[20] the second (Macintosh 1988, Windows 1990) could also
        produce color 35 mm slides.[20] The third version (Windows and Macintosh
        1992) introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital
        projectors, which would over time completely replace physical
        transparencies and slides.[20] A dozen major versions since then have
        added many additional features and modes of operation[12] and have made
        PowerPoint available beyond Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows,
        adding versions for iOS, Android, and web access.[citati
